# axis_sum_on_7_segment
This is AXI steam interface enabled continuous adder which can display the result of 7 segment display after N number of inputs received. thanks to <https://verilogcodes.blogspot.com/2015/10/verilog-code-for-bcd-to-7-segment.html> for bcd to 7segment code.Top module is simulated on vivado. but not physically tested on FPGA. check out the following description for further details.
